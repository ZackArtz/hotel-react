# Hotel - React

## I used the Create React App Script to build the boilerplate project.

## Installing

To get deploy the app, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) downloaded and installed. 

I used the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for my package management, to get the app up and running, yarn is not required, but recommended. 

To install yarn, open cmd or a terminal and type
```
npm i -g yarn
```
use sudo if you are on linux/osx

Now to install the required dependencies, (react, etc.) type this in a terminal in the project's root directory.

```
yarn
```
or for npm
```
npm install
```

## Running

To start the development server, type this into a terminal in the project's root directory.
```
yarn start
```
or for npm
```
npm start
```

Thanks for reading! The project should automatically open up in a new browser window, if not it should be on http://localhost:3000
